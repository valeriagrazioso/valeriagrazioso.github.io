                <p>The goal of this project was to use photography as a way of documentation. We had to create a series of images that represented something. I decided  to use portraiture to document sibling relationships. I wanted to capture the genuine relationships between sibling at Notre Dame. I asked a series of siblings to pose for me, but I wanted to achieve pictures that looked natural and actually reflected the unique relationships that exist between siblings, sisters and brothers. The models were asked to act natural with each other as I took pictures of them interacting with each other. To get them to get more comfortable and to achieve expressions and emotions from them, I asked each other to tell significant stories or memories they had with their sibling. The end result was a series of six photos, printed on luster paper and that worked as a set. The photos helped document the different relationships between siblings.</p>
