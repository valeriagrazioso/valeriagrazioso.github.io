                <p>I am a Business Analytics and Visual Communication Design double major at the University of Notre Dame. And although at first glance my two majors seem to be very different from each other, they are in fact a lot more similar than you would think. Business Analytics is concerned with analyzing data and creating visualizations to represent those findings, which design enables me to do even better. I like being able to do both analytical and creative work. In this site you can find some of the work I have done over my past four years at Notre Dame. I have taken many classes that have pushed me to go further and really challenge myself. My portfolio site is only a glimpse of what I have worked on. The pieces selected were done so as a way to represent the different areas in which I have worked on and the variety of my work. I hope you enjoy my site! </p></div>

                <h4>Thank you for visiting my portfolio website!</h4>
